Hello, I am attempting to bridge two networks with zerotier.  Network one is in cf, Network 2 is in sl.  I have 3 devices in each network.  In network 1 (net1) we have node01, node02 and node03.  In network 2 (net2) we have node11, node12 and node13.  In net1 on node03 I have installed zerotier joined the zttestnetwork with IP 192.168.0.3/24 GW 192.168.0.1 with bridge enabled.  In net2 on node13 I have installed zerotier joined the zttestnetwork with IP 192.168.0.13/24 GW 192.168.0.1 with bridge enabled.  The GW with IP 192.168.0.1/24 device is in net1.  I configured node12 with IP 192.168.0.12/24 GW 192.168.0.4.  From node13 I attempted to ping node 12 and it fails.  Can you review this zerotier configuration and assist me with a step by step debugging plan please?

⚠️ Potential Issues
Missing bridge to physical interface: It's unclear if node03 and node13 are actually bridging their local physical interface to the ZT interface (ztX). 
ZeroTier alone doesn’t bridge unless you create a proper L2 bridge using brctl or bridge-utils/iproute2.

GW config on node12: You wrote that node12 has GW 192.168.0.4, but there's no mention of a node with .4. That might be a misconfiguration. Should it be .13 (node13)?

Forwarding / iptables: If ZeroTier is being used to bridge networks, IP forwarding must be enabled, and in many cases, iptables/NAT rules may interfere or be necessary.

ZT network rules: ZeroTier network permissions must allow bridging (broadcast/multicast, etc.)

## Debugging Plan
### ✅ Step 1: Check IP Addressing & Gateway
- Confirm the ZT IP addresses and host interface IPs using:
```bash
ip addr show
ip route
```
- Ensure that:
- All nodes on both sides have the correct ZT IP assigned.
- The gateway configured on node12 (192.168.0.12) is correct. If node13 is to route packets, node13’s IP should be set as the GW.
- Fix: If node13 is bridging Net2 to ZeroTier, node12's default gateway must be 192.168.0.13, not .4.
### ✅ Step 2: Enable IP Forwarding
- On node03 and node13, run:
```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
- And persist it by editing /etc/sysctl.conf:
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
### Step 3: Check Bridging is Actually Working
On node03 and node13, you must bridge the ZT interface (ztXXXXXX) with the LAN interface (e.g., eth0, enp1s0, etc.) using a Linux bridge:

```bash
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set ztXXXXXXXX master br0
ip link set eth0 master br0
ip link set br0 up
ip link set ztXXXXXXXX up
ip link set eth0 up
```
🧠 Note: Replace eth0 and ztXXXXXXXX with your actual interface names.

Also ensure bridge-utils or iproute2 is installed.

### Step 4: Verify ZT Connection Between node03 & node13
On both node03 and node13:

```bash
zerotier-cli listpeers
zerotier-cli listnetworks
ping 192.168.0.3   # from node13
ping 192.168.0.13  # from node03
```
✅ You should see a direct connection and successful ping.

### ✅ Step 5: Check ARP and Connectivity from node13 → node12
Try:

```bash
ping 192.168.0.12
arp -n
```
If ping fails and arp shows "incomplete", then ARP is not traversing the bridge properly. This usually points to bridging not working as expected.

### ✅ Step 6: Examine ZT Network Rules
In the ZeroTier web admin panel (my.zerotier.com):

Go to your network, check under Advanced → Enable:

"Allow Ethernet Bridging"
"Allow Global Broadcast"

Optionally disable "Managed IP Assignment" if you're assigning IPs manually.

### ✅ Step 7: Firewall Rules
Ensure that iptables isn't blocking forwarding:

```bash
iptables -L -v -n
iptables -t nat -L -v -n
```
Temporarily flush all to test:

```bash
iptables -F
iptables -t nat -F
```
⚠️ Only do this in a test environment or if you understand the consequences.

### ✅ Step 8: Try a Static Route
If bridging fails or is undesirable, try using routing instead.

- On node12:
```bash
ip route add 192.168.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.13
```
- Then verify routing works without bridging.

## bridge setup scripts

node03 (Net1) and node13 (Net2), are bridging their local LAN interface with the ZeroTier virtual interface. Create a

🧰 Prerequisites
You'll need:

bridge-utils or modern iproute2 (most Linux distros have ip commands).

The LAN interface name (e.g., eth0, ens3, etc.).

The ZeroTier interface name, usually something like ztxxxxxx (you can find it with ip link).

### 🔍 Step 1: Identify Interface Names
On each node (node03 and node13), run:

```bash
ip link show
```

Your LAN interface (usually connected to your local subnet; example: eth0, enp1s0).

Your ZeroTier interface (starts with zt; e.g., ztabcdef1234).

🧠 Example Assumptions:
Let’s assume on both nodes:

LAN interface: eth0

ZeroTier interface: ztabcdef1234

Replace with actual values on your systems.

📜 Bridge Setup Script (for node03 and node13)
Save this as setup-bridge.sh and run it with sudo:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Replace these with your actual interface names
LAN_IF="eth0"
ZT_IF="ztabcdef1234"
BRIDGE_IF="br0"

echo "Creating bridge $BRIDGE_IF..."
```

# Delete if already exists
```bash
ip link set $LAN_IF down
ip link set $ZT_IF down
ip link delete $BRIDGE_IF type bridge 2>/dev/null
```

# Create the bridge
```bash
ip link add name $BRIDGE_IF type bridge
```

# Add interfaces to bridge
```bash
ip link set $LAN_IF master $BRIDGE_IF
ip link set $ZT_IF master $BRIDGE_IF
```

# Bring interfaces up
```bash
ip link set $LAN_IF up
ip link set $ZT_IF up
ip link set $BRIDGE_IF up
```

# Enable IP forwarding
```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo "Bridge $BRIDGE_IF setup complete. Bridged $LAN_IF with $ZT_IF."
```
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup-bridge.sh
```
- Then run:
```bash
sudo ./setup-bridge.sh
```

🧪 After Running the Script
- Check the bridge:
```bash
bridge link
ip addr show br0
```

- Verify traffic flow:
- From node12, ping 192.168.0.13 (node13).
- Then try ping 192.168.0.3 (node03).
- Finally, ping 192.168.0.1 (GW).

- Check ARP tables:
```bash
arp -n
```
🧹 Optional Cleanup Script (for testing)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LAN_IF="eth0"
ZT_IF="ztabcdef1234"
BRIDGE_IF="br0"

ip link set $LAN_IF down
ip link set $ZT_IF down
ip link set $BRIDGE_IF down
ip link set $LAN_IF nomaster
ip link set $ZT_IF nomaster
ip link delete $BRIDGE_IF type bridge
ip link set $LAN_IF up
ip link set $ZT_IF up
```
